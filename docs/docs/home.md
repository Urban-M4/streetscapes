## Introduction

The Streetscapes project is based on and extends the existing [Global Streetscapes](https://ual.sg/project/global-streetscapes/) project.

## Goals

Streetscapes is a project within a project. The aim of the parent project ([Urban-M4](https://github.com/Urban-M4)) aims to model the Urban Heat Island effect with the help of various software tools. As part of this Urban-M4 ecosystem, Streetscapes provides a streamlined API for downloading, segmenting and analysing street view imagery (SVI). Specifically, the analysis is geared towards evaluating the properties of individual objects in the images (such as buildings, roads and sidewalks) that could help estimate the amount of heat trapped in urban environments.
